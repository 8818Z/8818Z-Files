1:53 Started working on chassis
2:14 Finished right chassis, know bug is that gear is slightly bigger then wheel. Tilitng the chassis to the chassis direction will prove nessasary to keep the chassis working
2:18 Started working on left chassis
2:44 Finished left chassis
2:45 Thinking of ideas to fix gear problem
2:46 Starting to redo geartrain
3:14 Finished Lrft geartrain, doing right tommorow

2023-08-15: Day 2:  Members: Joshua, Ryan

10:00 Reworking An extension that was used on the bar to extend it(Ryan)
10:07 Finished Right chassis
10:22 Fixed issues with left chassis, that caused the wheel to collide with the outer beam. Also added general stability shafts.
10:53 Finished main part of chassis
11:03 Stabilizing chassis
11:45 Finished Stabilizing chassis. Also did some wire organization so we dont have to disassemble everything in the future to organize a wire
11:55 Working on tower
11:59 Finished tower, added triangle for stability
1:07 Started Working on the intake
1:30 finished intake rollers
1:31 Started attaching intake to tower
1:50 intaketesting.mp4 is filmed

2:51 Fixing some torque and Height issues
3:15 Fixed up problems
3:20 active intaketesting.mp4 filmed


2023-08-16: Day 3:  Members: Joshua, Ryan
10:00 Started to fix size limit problems with the robot, motor was outside, and shaft was too long
10:14 Finished fixing size limit issues. Starting to work on robot durabiliby and bucket
10:27 Increased durabiliby of the robot and the tower.
