2023/8/14:Initial Start  Members: Joshua, Ryan
1:53 Started working on chassis
2:14 Finished right chassis, know bug is that gear is slightly bigger then wheel. Tilitng the chassis to the chassis direction will prove nessasary to keep the chassis working
2:18 Started working on left chassis
2:44 Finished left chassis
2:45 Thinking of ideas to fix gear problem
2:46 Starting to redo geartrain
3:14 Finished Lrft geartrain, doing right tommorow

2023-08-15: Day 2:  Members: Joshua, Ryan
9:50 Started working on Right chassis
10:00 Reworking An extension that was used on the bar to extend it(Ryan)
10:07 Finished Right chassis
10:22 Fixed issues with left chassis, that caused the wheel to collide with the outer beam. Also added general stability shafts.
10:53 Finished main part of chassis
11:03 Stabilizing chassis
11:45 Finished Stabilizing chassis. Also did some wire organization so we dont have to disassemble everything in the future to organize a wire
11:55 Working on tower
11:59 Finished tower, added triangle for stability
1:07 Started Working on the intake
1:30 finished intake rollers
1:31 Started attaching intake to tower
1:50 intaketesting.mp4 is filmed
2:50 Finished Intake mounting added chains to connect to intake rollers, and added a motor.
2:51 Fixing some torque and Height issues
3:15 Fixed up problems
3:20 active intaketesting.mp4 filmed


2023-08-16: Day 3:  Members: Joshua, Ryan
10:00 Started to fix size limit problems with the robot, motor was outside, and shaft was too long
10:14 Finished fixing size limit issues. Starting to work on robot durabiliby and bucket
10:27 Increased durabiliby of the robot and the tower.
11:34 Finished bucket going to start mounting the bucket
1:58 Changed bucket angle, also made major changes to the bucket, including covering it in plasic, changing the position around, and messing around with the mounting position
4:19 Finished a POC of the bucket, added walls to the bucket, added basic dumper code to the testing code, and also Increased durabiliby and durabiliby of the connecters

2023-08-17: Day 4
10:00 Started to widen bucket, so we can hold more cubes at a time
10:27 finished making the bucket wider, now making roof for the bucket
10:43 added plastic to entrance of the bucket, so cubes won't keep falling out
10:50 added a beam to secure the tower, finishing the bucket roof
11:14 changed sprockets on bucket to gears for more torque, when we added the roof and walls bucket got much heavier
11:31 adding more triangles to the robot to makfe it more sturdy and durable
11:47 Finished adding triangles and one beams to the tower
11:57: addng another tower mounted to the back beam
1:10 Relocating motor, added 1 beams to secure the tower to the chassis.
2:50 Finished Relocating motor
3:14 adding roof to the bucket
4:15 Relocated brain. Also finished a chain mechanisim with a double gear mechanisim so lift the bucket

2023-08-18: Day 5  Members: Joshua, Ryan
9:53 Reversing the sprockets and motors, so the robot will fit within the size limit. Also labaling the wires, and rewiring the robot.
10:37 finished reversing gears and sprokets, now making robot even m,or narrow so it will stay in size limit
11:03 getting rid of gears, chaging to sprockets, and also adding another motor on the other side
1:05 Fixing the bucket scraping against the intake, adding a custom drive code, completly rewriting the code
2:09 Finished all fixes listed above. Now testing said fixes. Also changed the connecter holding the two plates of the bucket together, to a more stable one
2:24 starting to fix inverted turning pn the new drive code
2:50 finally finished fixing the drive code

2023-8-22 Day 6 Members: Ryan, Joshua
1:25 making floor of intake wider so robot can collect more cubes at a time
2:37 turns out that intake didn't need floor, it could can collect right off the ground, now testing bucket
3:17 adding more walls to bucket so cubes won't get jammed in the the sides


2023-9-5 Day 7 Members Ryan, Joshua, Justin
4:08 Replaced Small sprockets with massive ones
4:51 Addung plastic walls, changed gear ratio of the intake, flattened the dumper plastic;fixing the dumper slant
5:20 finished changing gear ratio, now started making small towers connected to intake


2023-9-6 Day 8 Members Ryan, Justin
4:25 started making small walls on bucket so cubes won't slide out the sides so easily
5:01 made walls inside the roller so cubes won't get stuck inn the side
5:21 testing how many cubes robot can carry at once and dump into boxes


2023-9-10 Day9 Members: Ryan,Justin, Joshua
3:56 Removing parts from the intake so that it can fit in the 11 inch size limit


2023-9-11 Day 10 Members: Ryan, Justin, Joshua
4:00 Fixed issue with intake getting stuck easily
4:30 Making barrier to make the robot unable to suck up purple cubes (really close with the size limit, ngl)
4:52 Making the bucket drop less cubes when dumping
5:10 Adding a automatic idle lock to the code, slowmode, and general readability changes, using VSCode formatter

2023-9-12 Day 11 Members:Ryan, Justin, Joshua
4:51 started making bucket more stabilized, it kept getting loose
5:16 Replaced all the connecters with more stables ones to make the bucket lifting better
